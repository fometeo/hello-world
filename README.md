# hello-world

about myself

IT staff at national meteorological and geophysics organization.
Over 27 years at IT at full time, partial before, and still interested.
I loved Lego, build from small parts, projects, and so computers.
XZ Spectrum was a pleasant discovery, first with games...
then basic, later with Z80 assembler, and Pascal (yes it had! )
This year I discovered Minecraft on an old PS3 and I'm enjoying it.
There is something with virtualization I like, since Virtual PC 2004.
Later on VMware also had a free option. Docker, containers, and so...
still do not have for me the same charm and elegance.
Now with COVID-19 telework there is some more time to explore.
And saw this GitHub guide, so just following it :-)
