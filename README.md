Follwing the above guide there was a conflit I can not see how to solve.
You are invited into here to also try the Guide or comment on the issue.

testing with some text:

I heard that Roblox is more complete in construction objects and mechanisms, 
however I find a special charm in Minecraft in its simplicity balance, 
and exploration under the ground, in mines and caves. 

Anyway I'm told the Minecraft version on PC has expanded a lot, very much, 
what one can do. I prefer the classic, at an old PS3, over a big display.
