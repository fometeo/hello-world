# hello-world

I heard that Roblox is more complete in construction objects and mechanisms, however I find a special charm in Minecraft in its simplicity and balance, and exploration under the ground, in mines and caves. Anyway I'm told the Minecraft version on PC has expanded a lot, very much, what one can do. I prefer the classic, by now, at an old PS3, over a big display :-)
